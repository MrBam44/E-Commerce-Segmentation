# E-Commerce-Segmentation
Customer segmentation is an effective tool for businesses to closely align their strategy and tactics with, and better target, their customers. Every customer is different and every customer journey is different so a single approach often isnâ€™t going to work for all. This is where customer segmentation becomes a valuable process.

Customer segmentation can be broken down into two types:

 - Segmenting customers based on who they are: the process of understanding who customers are typically focuses on demographics.
 - Segmenting customers based on what they do: you can also segment customers based on how much they spend (share of wallet), how often, and what products (this allows you to see how much you can increase spend). This is more behavior focused. That's the data we have and the kind of segmentation we will do.
